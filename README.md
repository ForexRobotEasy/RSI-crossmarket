## Input Parameters

- `RSI_Period`: The period used to calculate the RSI indicator.
- `RSI_Threshold`: The threshold value used to determine whether the RSI is considered high.
- `StopLoss_Percentage`: The percentage value used to calculate the Stop Loss level.

## Expert Functions

### `OnInit`

This function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate a successful initialization.

### `OnDeinit`

This function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. It does not perform any actions.

### `OnTick`

This function is called on each tick of the market. It calculates the RSI for each market specified and determines whether the RSI is considered high based on the threshold value. If the RSI is high and no order is currently open, it places a buy order. 

If an order is open, it calculates the current price and adjusts the Stop Loss and Take Profit levels accordingly. If the order is in a loss and the drawdown is above 100, it places a sell order to hedge the position.
